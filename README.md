## Features
All features from the proposal were implemented. This app serves as a dashboard
for users to view the E-Commerce system. Think of it as an admin portal for users to monitor
E-Commerce activity. 

Some of the features implemented:
 - User login 
 - Users can view their personal details
 - Users can view their orders and details such as total paid, taxes, etc.
 - Users can view the items associated with each order
 - Users can view where their orders will be shipped to and by whom
 - Users can view what credit card was used to pay for the order
 - Users can view what products are available and search by vendor
 - We provide some relevant metrics about the E-commerce system as well
    - Vendor most purchased from
    - Most frequently bought product
    - Most liked product (determined by # of cart adds)
